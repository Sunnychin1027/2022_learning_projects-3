In the game window, there are three components: bricks, ball, and paddle. The player controls the position of the paddle with the mouse and bounces the falling ball upward to eliminate all the bricks in the brick area. The ball will bounce off any object or boundary it encounters, except for the bottom boundary of the game window. The game terminates under two conditions:

1. The player successfully eliminates all the bricks in the window—level cleared!
2. When the ball goes beyond the bottom boundary of the window three times—Game Over!
